    void&#160;&#160;Append (const uint8_t *data, size_t length)Used to append partial binary input data to compute the hash in a streaming fashion.  



    std::vector&lt; uint8_t &gt;&#160;&#160;Final (const uint8_t *data, size_t length)Computes the hash value of the specified binary input data, including any previously appended.
