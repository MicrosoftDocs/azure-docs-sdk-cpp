- content: Proposed duration the lease should continue before it is broken, in seconds, between 0 and 60. This break period is only used if it is shorter than the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may be held for longer than the break period.
