- content: The ETag contains a value which represents the version of the share snapshot, in quotes. A share snapshot cannot be modified, so the ETag of a given share snapshot never changes. However, if new metadata was supplied with the Snapshot Share request then the ETag of the share snapshot differs from that of the base share. If no metadata was specified with the request, the ETag of the share snapshot is identical to that of the base share at the time the share snapshot was taken.
