    Models::StartPosition&#160;&#160;StartPositionStartPosition is the position we will start receiving events from, either an offset (inclusive) with Offset, or receiving events received after a specific time using EnqueuedTime.  




    Azure::Nullable&lt; std::int64_t &gt;&#160;&#160;OwnerLevel {}OwnerLevel is the priority for this partition client, also known as the 'epoch' level. When used, a partition client with a higher OwnerLevel will take ownership of a partition from partition clients with a lower OwnerLevel. Default is off. 



    int32_t&#160;&#160;Prefetch = 300Prefetch represents the size of the internal prefetch buffer. When set, this client will attempt to always maintain an internal cache of events of this size, asynchronously, increasing the odds that ReceiveEvents() will use a locally stored cache of events, rather than having to wait for events to arrive from the network.
