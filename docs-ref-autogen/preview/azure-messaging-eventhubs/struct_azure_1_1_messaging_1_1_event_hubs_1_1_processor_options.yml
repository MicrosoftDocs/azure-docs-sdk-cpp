    Models::ProcessorStrategy&#160;&#160;LoadBalancingStrategyLoadBalancingStrategy dictates how concurrent Processor instances distribute ownership of partitions between them. The default strategy is ProcessorStrategyBalanced.  




    Azure::DateTime::duration&#160;&#160;UpdateInterval {std::chrono::seconds(10)}UpdateInterval controls how often attempt to claim partitions. The default value is 10 seconds. 




    Azure::DateTime::duration&#160;&#160;PartitionExpirationDuration {std::chrono::seconds(60)}PartitionExpirationDuration is the amount of time before a partition is considered unowned. The default value is 60 seconds. 




    Models::StartPositions&#160;&#160;StartPositionsStartPositions are the default start positions (configurable per partition, or with an overall default value) if a checkpoint is not found in the CheckpointStore. The default position is Latest. 



    int32_t&#160;&#160;Prefetch {300}Prefetch represents the size of the internal prefetch buffer for each ProcessorPartitionClient created by this Processor. When set, this client will attempt to always maintain an internal cache of events of this size, asynchronously, increasing the odds that ReceiveEvents() will use a locally stored cache of events, rather than having to wait for events to arrive from the network.  



    int32_t&#160;&#160;MaximumNumberOfPartitions {0}Specifies the maximum number of partitions to process.
