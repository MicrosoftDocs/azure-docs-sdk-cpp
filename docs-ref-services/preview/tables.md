# Azure Tables libraries for C++

Azure Tables is a cloud-based service that stores structured NoSQL data, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Because Tables is schemaless, it's easy to adapt your data as the needs of your application evolve. Access to Tables data is fast and cost-effective for many types of applications, and is typically lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes of data.
